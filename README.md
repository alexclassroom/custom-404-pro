![Banner](banner-772x250.png "Banner")

Override the default 404 page with **any page** from the Admin Panel or a **Custom URL**.

**UPDATE**: Version 3.0.0 of the plugin is completely written from the ground-up and has a completely new logging mechanism. If your old logs are important, please do not upgrade as of now. If you are facing performance/SEO issues and your old logs don't matter as much, you should be the first ones to upgrade.
